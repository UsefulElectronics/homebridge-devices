## Hardware Setup and Camera Test

It is possible to do all these steps like me over SSH connection remotely 
on windows command prompt use the following command. of SSH server should be running on your SBC 
ssh (user-name)@192.168.1.133 	//This is just an example use your own SBC IP and user name
First of all make all your packages and dependencies are up to date 

sudo apt update 

After that

sudo apt upgrade 

If you are on raspberry pi on Rasbian Bullseye OS you need to enable camera peripheral using

sudo raspi-config 

to open raspberry pi software configuration tool 

Interface Options -> Legacy Camera Enable

After connecting your camera to your SBC while it is not powered. Use this command

vcgencmd get_camera

to make sure that your camera is detected by the raspberry pi so if everything is ok you are supposed to get thus message 

supported=1 detected=1

otherwise you need to start troubleshooting

It is possible to test the camera by taking a photo using the following command 
raspistill -o test.jpg

The SBC will take a picture using the camera and store the captured frame at the following directory 
/home/(user-name)

It is possible to view test.jpg by transfering test.jpg file to your host machine. to do it on windows open powershell and execute scp command the follwoing way 

scp user-name@192.168.1.112:/home/user-name/test.jpg "C:\Users\user-name\Downloads\" 	// or any directory 

## RTSP Server Setup

git clone https://github.com/mpromonet/v4l2rtspserver.git		//Download rtsp sever project source code
cd v4l2rtspserver												//Enter downloaded file directory 
mkdir build														//create build directory for compilation convinent 
cd build														//Enter created directory
cmake ..														//Is used in the CMake build system to generate the necessary build files for compiling a project
make -j$(nproc)													//This compiles the project using multiple CPU cores for faster execution.
sudo make install												//Copies the compiled program and related files (like libraries, config files) to system directories 

Note that  CMake command does the follwoing 
1- searches for a CMakeLists.txt file in the parent directory (..).
2- creates build system files (e.g., Makefile for GNU Make) based on the project's configuration.
3- checks dependencies, sets compiler flags, and prepares the environment for make.
