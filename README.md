HLK-LD2410 24GHz mmWave radar is interfaced by ESP32C6 micro-controller that reads radar detection data to report motion detection status over MQTT topic that iHost gateway is subscribed to. With the help of Homebridge MQTTThing, motion detection status can be monitored from iPhone Home App.

Sonoff iHost gateway makes communication between smartphone and the connected low power zigbee devices possible. The gateway can be integrated with many plugins that extends home automation limits like Tasmota, NodeRed, eWeLink and Homebridge.

Homebridge  plugin makes integrating costume DIY  IoT devices to home automation system a piece of cake, which is ideal for ESP32 based DIY devices. This tutorial is a good example of adding a custome ESP32 based sensor to home automation system
